abstract: "As wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been applied across a spectrum of application domains, the problem of source location privacy (SLP) has emerged as a significant issue, particularly in security-critical situations. In the seminal work on SLP, phantom routing was proposed as a viable approach to address SLP. However, recent work has shown some limitations of phantom routing such as poor performance with multiple sources. In this paper, we propose phantom walkabouts, a novel version and more general version of phantom routing, which performs phantom routes of variable lengths. Through extensive simulations we show that phantom walkabouts provides high SLP levels with a low message overhead and hence, low energy usage."
