title: "PNT Cyber Resilience: a Lab2Live Observer Based Approach"
excerpt: "Vehicular position, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems are of vital importance to current vehicles, future autonomous vehicles and infrastructure depending on time synchronisation. Existing GNSS infrastructure has limited mitigation to prevent a variety of attacks. This project performed a short feasibility study on practical attacks against a vehicle's PNT system using a PNT attack emulator."

For PNT Cyber Resilience, WMG researchers, led by [Dr Matthew Higgins](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=1279), [Professor Paul Jennings](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=125) and [Professor Tim Watson](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=1077), worked alongside [Spirent Communications](https://www.spirent.com/) to investigate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) products and services to demonstrate and determine the feasibility of a new observer-based technique to attack and test CAV PNT-related functions in both controlled and real-world scenarios. Based on experience gained performing real-world testing, interviews with domain experts and a survey of the academic literature, a set of specifications for CAV cyber-security testbeds to perform PNT testing was made.
