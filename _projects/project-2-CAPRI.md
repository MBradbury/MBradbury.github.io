title: "CAPRI"
excerpt: "As connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to become commonplace on roads nationwide, new featured are being integrated into vehicles. This includes functionality such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication and machine learning models. It is important that we investigate and address security issues posed by the larger attack surface before a wide deployment. This project designed a reference architecture which facilitated attack surface analysis of connected autonomous vehicles."

As part of the [CAPRI project](https://caprimobility.com/about/support) I worked on developing a reference architecture for connected autonomous vehicles to be used to perform an attack surface analysis of a highly complex system.
