title: "Securing Convergent Ultra-large Scale Infrastructures Programme"
excerpt: "The SCULI programme will draw on a unique mix of expertise, spanning sociotechnical approaches, theoretical and applied computer science, to transform the way we conceptualise and deliver cyber security in a world with connectivity at unprecedented scale, prevalence of legacy and non-legacy systems, complex technology stacks, complicated supply chains and myriad intersections of humans and technologies."

Large critical infrastructures are subject to serious disruptions due to cyber attacks, so improving their security is of significant importance. However, it is also important to move past viewing critical infrastructure as isolated, communication, timing, power, water, transport, smart cities, smart farming and many others are all interconnected. This interconnectivity is vital to consider when attemtping to secure this infrasturcture. The Securing Convergent Ultra-large Scale Infrastructures (SCULI) programme will investigate what guarantees can be provided and how to orchestrate interactions under the assumption of partially trusted and partially compromised infrastructures.
