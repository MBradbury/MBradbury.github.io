title: "FAIR-SPACE"
excerpt: "Access to space is becoming increasingly cheaper, meaning companies and organisations who were previously priced out of the market are now considering space-based deployments. These deployments may also include novel functionality such as debris collection. New entrants will lack the knowledge that well-established space organisations have about how to secure these systems and the new functionality will increase the ways in which these systems will be attacked. This project looked at ways in which these vulnerabilities could be identified and then formally proved to not be present."

The [FAIR-SPACE](http://fairspacehub.org/) hub aimed to further the use of AI and robotics for future space missions. As part of this project I was involved with developing techniques for security-minded verification of space systems. This involved working with colleagues at the University of Liverpool who focus on formal verification to develop hybrid methodologies that considered security aspects of space systems.
