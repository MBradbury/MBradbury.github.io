abstract: "The space sector is changing from state-supported space exploration to commercial space exploration, giving rise to NewSpace. The role of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in this rapid growth is increasing, but experience in other sectors shows SMEs may not be sufficiently focused on cyber security issues. In this exploratory study, we investigated the Influence of New Entrants to the Space Industry on Cybersecurity, according to industry stakeholders. To explore this question, we carried out 8 semi structured interviews with NewSpace organisations directly involved in the design, development or review of space system devices and services, including SMEs, large businesses, governmental and not for profit, non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Our findings highlight crucial areas in cybersecurity which may be influenced by the advent of new entrants to the space industry, such as technology infrastructure, philosophical approaches to cybersecurity maturity, vulnerability disclosure culture, and regulatory aspects. These are the areas where intervention to promote healthy cybersecurity practices can be directed and be achieved through collaborations amongst the developers, end users and regulators."

The space sector is seeing rapid growth amongst commercial organisations, giving rise to NewSpace. Established organisations involved in the space sector or typically governmental or private sector organisations for which there has been a need to secure the system's deployed. However, new small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) entering the sector encounter challenges ensuring the security of their system. In this paper we undertook 8 semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives on space cyber security.

## Perspectives

In these interviews we found that new entrants to the space sector encountered a number of challenges with securing space systems. This included:
 * Cyber security training and skills specific to space-based systems
 * The cost of implementing security versus a client's willingness to pay for it
 * The impact of how long such equipment will be deployed for and the challenges this poses
 * Concerns about the hardware component supply chain
 * The reality of limited vulnerability information sharing

Overall, similar themes were identified compared to terrestrial critical national infrastructure (CNI). However, there are a number of space specific concerns not found in terrestrial CNI, such as the large number of SME entrants and the regulatory landscape.
