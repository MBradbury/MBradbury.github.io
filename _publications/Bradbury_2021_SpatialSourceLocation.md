abstract: "Source Location Privacy (SLP) is an important property for monitoring assets in privacy-critical sensor network and Internet of Things applications. Many SLP-aware routing techniques exist, with most striking a tradeoff between SLP and other key metrics such as energy (due to battery power). Typically, the number of messages sent has been used as a proxy for the energy consumed. Existing work (for SLP against a local attacker) does not consider the impact of sleeping via duty cycling to reduce the energy cost of an SLP-aware routing protocol. Therefore, two main challenges exist: (i) how to achieve a low duty cycle without loss of control messages that configure the SLP protocol and (ii) how to achieve high SLP without requiring a long time spent awake. In this article, we present a novel formalisation of a duty cycling protocol as a transformation process. Using derived transformation rules, we present the first duty cycling protocol for an SLP-aware routing protocol for a local eavesdropping attacker. Simulation results on grids demonstrate a duty cycle of 10%, while only increasing the capture ratio of the source by 3 percentage points, and testbed experiments on FlockLab demonstrate an 80% reduction in the average current draw."

Source Location Privacy (SLP) is an important problem when monitoring valuable assets with wireless sensors. It is important that sensitive context information, such as the location of an asset, is not revealed to adversaries. These wireless sensors are typically deployed with a limited energy source, so protection approaches need to consider their energy cost. In order to save energy, applications deployed on these devices perform duty cycling, where they aim to spend the majority of their lifetime sleeping. However, arbitrary duty cycling algorithms can lead to delays in messages being sent and received. For SLP algorithms that involve time sensitive messages an arbitrary duty cycle will impact the ability to provide SLP. So this paper proposed a duty cycling algorithm that uses knowledge of the SLP protocol to calculate when to wake up and when to sleep.

## Importance

Without an effective duty cycle algorithm wireless sensors will have a very short lifetime, making them costly to deploy and maintain. So it is vital that algorithms developed for wireless sensor are evaluated with appropriate duty cycles and the impact duty cycling has on the efficacy of the protocols is evaluated. This work is the first to investigate the impact of duty cycling on SLP techniques against an adversary with local visibility. Existing technqiues against an adversary with global visibility tend to lend themselves naturally to duty cycles techniques which perform Time-division multiple access.

## Perspectives

Existing technqiues to provide source location privacy in wireless sensor networks usually do not consider that sensor nodes sleep for the majority of their lifetime. Instead energy cost is measured in terms of messages sent and received. This approach was used as sending and receiving messages tends to be the most expensive individual operation that a wireless sensor node will perform, however, it ignores the continuous [cost of keeping the CPU and other peripherals active](/publications/Bradbury_2019_ImpactDecreasingTransmit) instead of sleeping which can dominate the energy cost to send and receive messages over time. Future work evaluating the energy cost of applications on equivalent hardware needs to ensure appropriate evaluation techniques are used.
