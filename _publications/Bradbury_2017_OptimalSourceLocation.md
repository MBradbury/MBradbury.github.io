abstract: "As interest in using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for deployments in scenarios such as asset monitoring increases, the need to consider security and privacy issues also becomes greater. One such issue is that of Source Location Privacy (SLP) where the location of a source in the network needs to be kept secret from a malicious attacker. Many techniques have been proposed to provide SLP against an eavesdropping attacker. Most techniques work by first developing an algorithm followed by extensive performance validation. Differently, in this paper, we model the SLP problem as an Integer Linear Programming optimization problem. Using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimiser, we obtain an optimal solution to provide SLP. However, that solution is centralised (i.e., requires network-wide knowledge) making the solution unsuitable for WSNs. Therefore, we develop a distributed version of the solution and evaluate the level of privacy provided by it. The solution is hybrid in nature, in that it uses both spatial and temporal redundancy to provide SLP. Results from extensive simulations using the TOSSIM WSN simulator indicate a 1% capture ratio is achievable as a trade-off for an increase in the delivery latency."

Source Location Privacy (SLP) is an important problem when monitoring valuable assets with wireless sensors. It is important that sensitive context information, such as the location of an asset, is not revealed to adversaries. This work aimed to investigate optimal strategies to provide SLP by formulating the routing problem using integer linear programming (ILP). [IBM's ILOG CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) was used to obtain an optimal solution to the [model](https://github.com/MBradbury/slp-attacker-ilp). This solution aimed to delay and group messages until as late as possible and then deliver the messages to their destination. However, this solution made the assumption that wireless communication is perfectly reliable, which is not the case. So the optimal solution was recreated by a near-optimal routing algorithm that aimed to produce similar behaviour.

## Example

An example optimal solution can be found below, where the attacker starts at node 13 and the source at node 1 sends 7 messages. Each of these messages need to reach the sink at node 13 without the attacker reaching node 1.

## Importance

Using ILP to identify an optimal solution led to the discovery of an approach that had not previously been investigated in the literature. In this case delaying and grouping messages. Using a variety of techniques to obtain solutions to the same problem as different techniques can lead to different ways to solve the problem.

## Perspectives

Techniques such as ILP are useful in understanding what the optimal behaviour of a system could be, however, in practise the assumptions needed to obtain this optimal result (such as reliable wireless links) or global knowledge are unlikely to be present. This does not make technqiues to obtain unusable, but care must be taken in translating optimal results into algorithms that aim to replicate them closely.
