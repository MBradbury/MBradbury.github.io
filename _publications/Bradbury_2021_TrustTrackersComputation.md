abstract: "Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be deployed to enable applications such as sensing and actuation. These devices are typically resource-constrained and are unable to perform resource-intensive computations. Therefore, these jobs need to be offloaded to resource-rich nodes at the edge of the IoT network for execution. However, the timeliness and correctness of edge nodes may not be trusted (such as during high network load or attack). In this paper, we look at the applicability of trust for successful offloading. Traditionally, trust is computed at the application level, with suitable mechanisms to adjust for factors such as recency. However, these do not work well in IoT networks due to resource constraints. We propose a novel device called Trust Tracker (denoted by Σ) that provides higher-level applications with up-to-date trust information of the resource-rich nodes. We prove impossibility results regarding computation offloading and show that Σ is necessary and sufficient for correct offloading. We show that, Σ cannot be implemented even in a synchronous network and we compute the probability of offloading to a bad node, which we show to be negligible when a majority of nodes are correct. We perform a small-scale deployment to demonstrate our approach."

There is increasing interest in using highly resource-constrained IoT devices to perform complex tasks. These resource might include limited processing power (e.g., 32MHz CPU), RAM (e.g., 32 KiB to 256 KiB), ROM (512 KiB), and potentially no stable storage. However, because of the limited resources an IoT device may need to offload expensive tasks to resource-rich devices. These might be a Cloud server or an Edge node if the latency of task responses is important. In most cases, trust is built up reactively where an interaction is performed and the result of that interaction is used to update a trust model. In this work we instead adopt a proactive approach to assessing trust, where a challenge is periodically sent to each resource-rich device that a task could be offloaded to. This challenge is sufficiently expensive for the resource-rich device to compute a result, but cheap for the resource-constrained device to verify.

## Importance

Storing data and building a trust model reactively is expensive. For devices with limited memory it will not be possible to store a large amount of information on interaction histories. Proactive assessment is much cheaper, as all that needs to be stored is the result from the latest assessment. This means more memory can be dedicated to other features instead of building trust models.

## Perspectives

An issue with a reactive assessment of trust is that once a resource-constrained IoT device receives a response, it will not always be able to compute if that result was correct. To do so generally would require it executing the task itself. The proactive assessment, on the other hand, *can* be cheaply checked. Performing offloading based on a proactive assessment assumes that there is a link between a resource-rich device's willingness to perform an expensive task to demonstrate their trustworthiness in performing the actual task. There is the potential for a resource-rich device to perform the proactive assessment correctly, but then perform the task incorrectly. It is likely that a hybrid approach will need to be investigated.
