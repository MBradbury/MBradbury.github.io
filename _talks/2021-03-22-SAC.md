There is an increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) systems
comprised of resource-constrained sensor and actuator nodes executing
increasingly complex applications, possibly simultaneously.

IoT devices will not be able to execute computationally expensive
tasks and will require more powerful computing nodes, called edge
nodes, for such execution, in a process called computation offloading.

When multiple powerful nodes are available, a selection problem
arises: which edge node should a task be submitted to? This problem
is even more acute when the system is subjected to attacks,
such as DoS, or network perturbations such as system overload.

In this presentation,a trust model-based system architecture
for computation offloading is presented.
The system architecture provides confidentiality, authentication and
non-repudiation of messages in required scenarios and will operate
within the resource constraints of embedded IoT nodes.

The viability of the architecture is demonstrated with an example deployment
of Beta Reputation System trust model on real hardware.
