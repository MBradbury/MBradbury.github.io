[Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/about/) is an annual event where researchers share their work in a informal context (the pub) with the general public. The aim of these events is to inform in a relaxed environment without. This talk presented on my researcher undertaken during my [PhD](/projects/project-1-PhD) and included a live demonstration of members of the public using a directional antenna to find the location of a small transmitter.

The presentation is available [here](https://mbradbury.github.io/files/MBradbury_pint18.pptx).
