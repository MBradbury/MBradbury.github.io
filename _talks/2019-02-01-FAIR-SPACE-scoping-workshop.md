As part of the [FAIR-SPACE](/projects/project-4-FAIR-SPACE) project a workshop was held with members of academia and industry to identify cyber-security issue with robotic systems deployed in space and to scope out which of these issues were of high priority. [Dr. Marie Farell](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/marie.farrell.html) and myself led the discussion with the attendees after introductory talks from [Prof. Michael Fisher](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/michael.fisher.html) and [Prof. Carsten Maple](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=1102).

A variety of interesting issues were highlighted including:
 * managing legacy code and updating software of satellies
 * managing changing security standards, such as more computationally expensive cryptographic requirements
 * the lifetime of satellies before deorbiting means that dormant satellites could potentially be revived and used for malicious purposes
 * the impact of dual-use technology
 * satellite swarms and new ways of deploying technology in space leading to a larger attack surface
 * new entrants to the space industry being less aware of procedures compared to established organisations

A report of the issued highlighted during the workshop is available [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a6a02b0f6576ed25151ecfa/t/5c9ded139140b781bedc609a/1553853733673/WORKSHOP+REPORT_SPACE+SECURITY+SCOPING+February+2019.pdf) and a news article written for the FAIR-SPACE project is available [here](https://www.fairspacehub.org/news/2019/1/23/space-security-scoping-workshop).
