I was invited to give a talk to Coventry University's [Institute for Future Transport and Cities](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/institute-for-future-transport-and-cities/) on my work performed for [FAIR-SPACE](/projects/project-4-FAIR-SPACE) which investigated a formal verification of security properties of the generation of [Cooperative Awareness Messages](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/30263702/01.03.01_30/en_30263702v010301v.pdf). One of the conclusions of this presentation was the difficulty of verifying non-functional security properties.
