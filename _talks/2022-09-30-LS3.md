The Lancaster Symposium on Systems Security ([LS3](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/ls3/)) is a PhD student-led event (supervised by myself) which aims to bring together researchers from within [Lancaster University's System Security Group](https://ssg.lancs.ac.uk/) to share and explore the latest research on the security and privacy of computer systems and networks. The theme for 2022 was "Novel Challenges in System Security", focusing on new research within the area of system security.

For many students this was their first experience in presenting technical research to a group of their peers. The event provided valuable presentation experience, allowed for students and staff to give feedback on research, and facilitated new collaborations within the group.
