Resource-constrained IoT devices have traditionally been used for basic tasks such as sensing or actuating, but there is increasingly more interest in pushing complex applications closer to where digital systems interact with their environment.

This presentation of a [journal paper](/publications/Bradbury_2022_ThreatModellingGuided/) summarised work on trust-based task offloading and potential security issues wheile doing so.

The [paper](/publications/Bradbury_2022_ThreatModellingGuided/) this presentation is based on was presented at [ACM SenSys](https://sensys.acm.org/2022/) as part of the Journal Presentations track. This work was performed under the [PETRAS](https://petras-iot.org) [TEAM](/projects/project-6-TEAM/) project.
