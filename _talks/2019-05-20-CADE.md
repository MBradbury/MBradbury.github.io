The Competitive Advantage in the Digital Economy ([CADE](https://warwick.ac.uk/cade19)) Forum aims to bring together academics and practitioners to discuss the challenges of the digital economy and present the latest cutting edge research. I was the Program Chair for the 2019 forum and that year the event focused on Smart Service Systems, Personal Data and Cyber Security. There were 28 speakers and 5 keynote speakers who gave presentations on a wide variety of topics. Funding to hold the event was obtained from a variety of sources, including winning funding from Warwick's [Institute of Advanced Study](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/ias/).
