[Next Generation Programmers](https://torgyn.github.io/nextgenprog/) was an event aimed to introduce programming to young adults (14 &ndash; 17 years old) in rural Kazakhstan which was organised by [Dr. Torgyn Erland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torgyn/). I delivered three 1 hour sessions to introduce the attendees to software development, the interesting problems that can be solved using it, and pertinent cyber security issues that the attendees were likely to encounter.

This included:
 - What makes a strong password,
 - The value of personal information,
 - Recognising spam email,
 - Alternatives to pirating software,
 - The need for these skills, and
 - The importance of using these skills ethically.

The slides included a large amount of cyber security jargon in text in order to help introduce non-native English speakers to these words.
