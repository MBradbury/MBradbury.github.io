[ORBIT](https://www.orbit-rri.org)'s aim is to promote Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) to ensure the sustainability, acceptability and desirability of research. As part of this goal in June of 2019 they ran an Ethical Hackathon on Cyber Security of satellite systems. I was invited to give a guest talk on work applying formal verification to prove security properties of space systems being performed in the [FAIR-SPACE](/projects/project-4-FAIR-SPACE) hub. The [summary](https://www.orbit-rri.org/blog/2019/06/07/orbit-delivered-first-ethical-hackathon-royal-holloway/) of the event highlighted the depth understanding participants gained of RRI issues related to cyber security.
