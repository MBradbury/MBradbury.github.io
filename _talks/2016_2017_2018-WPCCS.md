The Warwick Postgraduate Colloquium in Computer Science ([WPCCS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/wpccs)) is a PhD student-run event which showcases the research performed by PhD students in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick. I was chair of [WPCCS 2016](https://warwick.ac.uk/wpccs16) and a member of the programme comittee for [WPCCS 2017](https://warwick.ac.uk/wpccs17) and [WPCCS 2018](https://warwick.ac.uk/wpccs18). Each year we received more presentations and posters submitted to the event as we tried to increase the event's similarity to conferences PhD students would attend.

For many students this was their first experience in presenting technical research to a group of their peers. The event provided valuable presentation experience, allowed for students and staff to give feedback on research, and facilitated new collaboarations within the department.
