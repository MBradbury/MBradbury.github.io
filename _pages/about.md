I am a Research Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk).

My research has explored a variety of issues involving security, privacy and trust in resource-constrained systems. This has ranged from context privacy issues in [vehicles](https://github.com/MBradbury/publications/raw/master/papers/Access2020.pdf) and [wireless sensor networks](/projects/project-1-PhD/), and security of different aspects of vehicular systems (including: [system analysis](/projects/project-2-CAPRI), [real-world testing](/projects/project-3-IoT-TRaM) and [PNT](/projects/project-5-PNT)).

I am currently working on the [TEAM](/projects/project-6-TEAM) project I co-developed, which was funded by [PETRAS](https://petras-iot.org) to perform trust-based task offloading from resource constrained devices to resource rich edge nodes.

I completed my undergraduate masters degree at Warwick in 2013 and spent a short period in industry before returning to the Computer Science Department at Warwick to undertake my [PhD](/projects/project-1-PhD/). During my PhD I worked in the Fault Tolerant and Reliable Systems subgroup of the Systems and Software group under my supervisor [Dr. Arshad Jhumka](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Arshad_Jhumka). I submitted my PhD in May 2018, after which I worked in the [Cyber Security Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/csc) in [WMG](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg) from April 2018 to March 2020.
