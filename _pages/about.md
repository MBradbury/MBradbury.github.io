I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in the [Security Systems Research Group](https://ssg.lancs.ac.uk/) of the [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) [School of Computing and Communications](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/).

## My Open Positions

If you are interested in undertaking a PhD on investigating technical privacy or security challenges in resource-constrained/autonomous cyber physical systems, please contact me by email.

* Senior Research Associate (18 Months) researching formal specification and verification in cyber physical systems. We are interested in properties involving the information revealed to an adversary. [Apply here](https://hr-jobs.lancs.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?ref=0228-23), closing date: 14th July 2023.
* Senior Research Associate (3 Years) researching [Generalised Context Privacy](/projects/project-8-GCP) in cyber physical systems. Application link to be provided shortly.
* PhD (fully funded for students with UK home fee status) on [Generalised Context Privacy](/projects/project-8-GCP) in cyber physical systems. [Apply here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/study/phd/phd-opportunities/), expected start October 2023 (flexible later start also available).

## Research

My research has explored a variety of issues involving security, context privacy and trust assessment in resource-constrained systems. This has ranged from context privacy issues in [vehicles](/publications/Bradbury_2020_PrivacyChallengesProtecting) and [wireless sensor networks](/projects/project-1-PhD/), and security of different aspects of vehicular systems (including: [system analysis](/projects/project-2-CAPRI), [real-world testing](/projects/project-3-IoT-TRaM) and [PNT](/projects/project-5-PNT)). I am interested in developing and testing practical solutions to security issues based on theoretical foundations.

## Bio

I completed my undergraduate Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk) in 2013 and spent a short period in industry before returning to the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk) to undertake my [PhD](/projects/project-1-PhD/) supervised by [Dr. Arshad Jhumka](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Arshad_Jhumka). I submitted my PhD in May 2018, after which I worked in the [Cyber Security Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/csc) in [WMG](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg) from April 2018 to March 2020. From March 2020 until March 2021 I was a Research Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk), where I worked on the [TEAM](/projects/project-6-TEAM) project which was funded by [PETRAS](https://petras-iot.org) to perform trust-based task offloading from resource constrained devices to resource rich edge nodes. Since April 2021 I have been a Lecturer at Lancaster University.

## Security Lancaster

The [Security Systems Group](https://ssg.lancs.ac.uk) at Lancaster has a number of open [PhD and Postdoc positions](https://ssg.lancs.ac.uk/open-positions/), please get in contact for further details. The group also runs frequent [events and seminars](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/security-lancaster/about/seminars-and-events/) on a wide range of security-focused topics.
