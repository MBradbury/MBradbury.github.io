I am a research fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk). I completed my undergraduate masters degree at Warwick in 2013 and spent a short period at Hitachi Data Systems before returning to the Computer Science Department at Warwick to undertake my [PhD](/projects/project-1-PhD/). During my PhD I worked in the Fault Tolerant and Reliable Systems subgroup of the Systems and Software group under my supervisor [Dr. Arshad Jhumka](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Arshad_Jhumka). I submitted my PhD in May 2018 and I worked in the [Cyber Security Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/csc) in [WMG](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg) from April 2018 to March 2020. I am currently based in the Computer Science Department working on a research project I co-developed to perform [trust-based task offloading from resource constrained devices to resource rich edge nodes](/projects/project-6-TEAM) funded by [PETRAS](https://petras-iot.org).
