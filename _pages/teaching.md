## Lancaster University, UK

Module Convenor for:
 - 2021 &ndash; current SCC.442 Penetration Testing <!-- https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/mpc/modules/015243/000121 -->
 - 2021 &ndash; 2025 SCC.306 Internet Applications Engineering <!-- https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/mpc/modules/016886/000121 -->

### SCC.442 Penetration Testing

In this module students are given a fast-paced introduction to Penetration Testing. Students are provided a collection of vulnerable virtual machines running modern operating systems (e.g., [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/News/2024/20241109), [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022) and [Window Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016)) to learn how to exploit vulnerabilities in a lab environment. Assessment consists of a formative group penetration testing challenge and a summative individual penetration testing challenge on a range of custom vulnerable machines developed for this module.

A wide range of vulnerabilities are incorporated into the lab environment, such as local privilege escalation with [CVE-2023-28252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28252), various web vulnerabilities by incorporating [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) and [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop), [permission misconfigurations](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html), [pivoting](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/700.html), [memory attacks](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html), and others.

Vulnerable machines are automatically constructed using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and based on templates modified from [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento). Test suites have been developed to ensure that the generated virtual machines are suitably vulnerable.

### SCC.306 Internet Applications Engineering

In this module students were given insight into current work building internet applications that is performed in industry. This was achieved by guest lectures from organisations such as the [BBC](https://bbc.co.uk), [Tesco](https://tesco.co.uk), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and others.

* Learnt to analyse website performance using [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools).
* Experience analysing historical data trends using [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction).
* Learnt how to read and apply web standards such as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) to identify and fix accessibility issues in a broken website.
